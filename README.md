# Procedural-Land
 Practice utilizing noise for infinite procedural landscapes and some additional practice utilizing shaders for simulated hydraulic erosion. WARNING: Due to communication from CPU to shader not being thread safe there is some janky-ness and performance issues. A possible fix would be to utilize Unitys job system and get rid of the hydraulic erosion in favor of faked erosion with noise.
